        <h2>A Universe for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
            The Space Telescope Science Institute is committed to making the world's
            astronomical information accessible to all.
        </p>

        <p>
            We approach this goal in many ways across our websites, sharing the latest
            scientific discoveries, mission updates, and plans for the future with the
            public and astronomy community through articles, images, videos, interactives,
            and other resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recognizing that our audience members come with different skills, interests,
            and background knowledge, we produce a variety of resources to meet people
            where they are. We recognize that these resources are only as good as an
            individual’s ability to use and find them, so we place particular emphasis on
            website accessibility.

        <h2>Building Multiple Paths</h2>
        <p>
            Many traditional web design techniques do not take into account the needs of all
            users. As such, we are continuously improving the design of this website.

        <ul>
            <li>Manual evaluation of the website using automated tools</li>
            <li>Analysis of user feedback</li>
            <li>Working with outside expertise and accessibility specialists</li>
            <li>Using principles that enhance clarity and improve experience</li>
